                    From chocolate to cheese, salami, wine, pickles and bread, many of the world’s greatest delicacies are
                    the products of fermentation. However, it wasn’t so long ago in our antibacterial-obsessed culture that
                    cheesemakers and chocolatiers downplayed the role of bacteria in their processes.
                </p>


                <p>
                    “We grew up with germ theory, antibacterial soap and the mantra, ‘Don’t leave it out; it will kill you!’
                    — those messages are deep in our psyche,” says Kirsten Shockey, co-author with (her husband Christopher
                    Shockey) of Fiery Ferments (Storey Publishing, 2017) and Fermented Vegetables (Storey Publishing, 2014).
                    That view is changing though, as our culture increasingly embraces live cultures for their health
                    benefits and the exciting flavors they impart.
                </p>

                    Fermentation is defined as the chemical breakdown of a substance by bacteria, yeasts or other
                    microorganisms, usually involving effervescence and the emission of heat. For some 9,000 years, humans
                    have manipulated this process to encourage certain strains of bacteria or fungi to grow in vegetables,
                    grains and dairy products to preserve them and add flavor.
                </p>


                






                <p>
                    For example, fermented dairy products like yogurt and kefir are considered symbiotic because they
                    contain both live bacteria in the form or probiotics as well as the fuel they need to thrive in the
                    form
                    of prebiotics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another reason nutritionists remain in favor of fermented foods is that their inherent good bacteria
                    unlocks vitamins and enzymes in other foods that our bodies might otherwise struggle to absorb.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Fermentation breaks starches down, making them more bioavailable,” says Shockey. “You absorb more
                    nutrients consuming fermented cabbage than raw, which is pretty darn cool.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vegetable fermentation is a great gateway to other kinds of fermentation because it’s simple to make
                    and, frankly, hard to screw up. “You don’t even need a starter — just vegetables, salt, a vessel and
                    time,” Shockey says.
                </p>

                <h3>Types of Fermentation</h3>
                <p>
                    The most common form of fermentation is lactic acid fermentation, which is used for making kimchi,
                    yogurt and certain kinds of pickles. Other common types include acetic fermentation (vinegar production)
                    and alcoholic fermentation (occurring in distillation).
    
                </p>

                <p>
                    “All of the food we eat is populated by various communities of microorganisms, so there isn’t just one
                    in play,” says Sandor Katz, author of the James Beard award-winning book The Art of Fermentation, and a
                    self-avowed fermentation revivalist. “Fermentation is simply a manipulation of scientific conditions to
                    encourage the growth of some organisms and discourage the growth of others.”
                </p>


                <p>
                    Lactic fermentation occurs in both sauerkraut and charcuterie, for example, when bacterial enzymes
                    transform protein into amino acids. Moisture is essential to inhibiting bad bacteria in the former
                    but
                    detrimental to the latter. In that case, trapped moisture can lead to spoilage.
                </p>


                <h3>
                    Funk is Good for You
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Much of the buzz surrounding the health benefits of fermented foods relates to probiotics, a type of
                    good bacteria thought to help with digestion and protect against harmful bacteria.
                </p>


                <p>
                    The other half of that equation is prebiotics, which are nondigestible carbohydrates that act as
                    food
                    for probiotics. When the two are combined, they are said to have certain health benefits.
