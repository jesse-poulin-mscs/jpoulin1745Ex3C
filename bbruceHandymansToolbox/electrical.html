            <h3>Electrical Safety</h3>
            <p>Here are a few tips for working safely with electricity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electrical shocks can kill, so don’t do repairs when you’re tired, distracted, or rushed.</li>
                <li>Follow a routine and double-check yourself each step of the way.</li>
                <li>Remember that just because hot wires are supposed to be colored and the neutral wire white, people don’t always follow the rules, especially if they don’t know what they’re doing.</li>
                <li>Double-check to make sure that the appliance is unplugged before you start to work on it.</li>
                <li>Turn off the circuit breaker or unplug the fuse that feeds electricity to the outlet or switch you want to work on. If in doubt, turn off all power to the house.</li>
                <li>Read instructions several times until the sequence is fixed in your mind.</li>
                <li>Examine cords and wires carefully so that you know which part is hot and which is neutral. Colored wires are supposed to be hot and white is neutral.</li>
                <li>Know your plugs. The narrow prong always carries electricity; the wide prong is neutral.</li>
                <li>Never work in or near water with power equipment.</li>
                <li>Don’t open the service panel while standing in water.</li>
                <li>Clearly label wires and bend them, in different directions so that no part of your hot wires accidentally touch each other.</li>
                <li>Check that the power is still off before you twist or splice wires together. Match color to color; don’t cross them.</li>
                <li>Always review each step to make sure you did it right, especially before turning the power back on.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Making safe wire connections</h3>
            <p>The first thing that you want to do before you begin making a wire connection is to make sure that you have turned off the circuit breaker. Even if the circuit breaker has been turned off, you will want to make sure that there’s no electricity running through the wire. Using a non-contact voltage tester, you will be able to confirm that the electricity has stopped. It is also highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves during this process to reduce the possibility of an electrical hazard.</p>
            <p>Second, you want to remove any insulation that may be on the wires. It’s common to use a wire stripper for this. If you’re looking for a new wire stripper, however, I would recommend getting one that can work both as a wire cutter and stripper.</p>

            <p>If you’re unsure of how much insulation you need to strip in order to create a strong and proper electrical connection, you can look on the packaging or the back of the connector itself. </p>
            <p>The type of wire connector that you decide to use can change the way you splice the wire. These include wire nuts, lever connectors, push in connectors, and more. We recommend using a Wago connector, which comes in many different types of connectors. All of them are easy to use no matter which you choose.</p>
            <p>Regardless of what type of connector you decide to use, be sure that you’re creating a strong electrical connection. A loose electrical connection is like a speed bump on the road. It will end up slowing down the electrical current while creating friction and heat. Too loose of a connection can also cause electricity to leap through the air from one conductor to another; this is known as arcing.</p>
            <p>Both of these are fire hazards, so you need to make sure there is a strong connection in order to avoid it. A Wago lever and push in connector feature an opening that lets you check the electric continuity or voltage without removing the wires and this will help when creating a long lasting connection.</p>
            <h3><strong>If you are unsure...call an electrician!</strong></h3>
            <p>Considering doing some electrical work on your own?  The Internet is a melting pot of tips, suggestions, recommendations and ideas about almost every aspect of human life. There are a lot of do-it-yourself or DIY tips on the Internet which promises that you can actually do almost everything on your own. However, there are instances when things would go beyond what your average hands could do. Sometimes, you will definitely need the help and service of professionals. This is especially true if you are dealing with electricity, electrical wirings, and installations. Indeed, small things like replacing busted light bulbs can already be done by yourself alone, but there are more serious electricity issues in your home that should be handled by an expert.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, you should know when to call an electrician. Basically, if a major wiring installation or replacement needs to be done and you do not have any background or experience in dealing with electrical wirings, then it is best to call an electrician. If you think something is wrong with a wiring in any of the rooms in your house, for example, the bathroom, do not attempt to do it yourself. The bathroom is a part of your house that usually gets wet because of constant use of water. Thus, the occurrence of being grounded and electrocuted is more likely to happen. You should not hastily grab your tools and try to fix it yourself.</p>
            <p>Another instance when you would need the help and expertise of an electrician is when you wish to add extra electrical wiring installations. This would most likely happen if you are to add electrical appliances and fixtures that need separate or additional wirings. If you attempt to do it yourself and did it incorrectly, then you’re in for more serious trouble. See, faulty wiring installations could lead to electrical fires and burns. So to ensure that everything is safe, you should seek the service of an electrician for any major electrical modifications and additions. If anything that has to do with electricity is done haphazardly, it could make way for more dangerous effects and serious troubles that could pose a threat to your household and family.</p>
            <p>Of course, it is still best to hire an electrician especially if you are to deal with major repairs and modifications in your home electrical system. Above all, they know what things, materials, and tools are needed to get the job done. They are also probably trained and have the adequate knowledge on safety measures especially when dealing with electrical systems. Electricians could also give you advice on how to take care of your electrical devices, wirings, and installations to avoid further damages.</p>
            <p>Hiring an electrician requires you to be more cautious and meticulous. You should make sure to hire an electrician that specializes in the area that you need to be done. For example, if you need to have a complete repair or replacement of wirings in a house or property that is already decades old, you should hire someone who has an experience and expertise in fixing electrical wirings of old houses.</p>

            <h3>Home Wiring Basics</h3>
            <p>Residential electrical wiring systems start with the utility's power lines and equipment that provide power to the home, known collectively as the service entrance. The power is run through an electric meter, which records how much energy is used in the home and is the basis for the monthly electric bill. In general, the utility company's jurisdiction stops with the meter. After that point, all of the electrical equipment is the homeowner's responsibility.</p>
            <h4>Service Entrance</h4>
            <p>
                The service entrance is the equipment that brings electrical power to the home. Most residential service includes three wires: two cables carrying 120 volts each (for a total of 240 volts) and one grounded neutral wire. If the cables are hung overhead, they are collectively called a service drop. If they are routed underground, they are known as a service lateral. A service drop connects to the home at a service head, or weather head, on the roof or exterior wall of the house.
            </p>
            <h4>Electric Meter</h4>
            <p>
                Once the power reaches the house via the service drop or service lateral cables, it passes through the electric meter, which may be mounted on an exterior wall or may be located inside the home's breaker box. The meter records all electricity used by the home, measured in kilowatt-hours, or kWh. A 100-watt light bulb burning for 10 hours uses 1 kWh of electricity. Meters may be analog or digital type, although most new meters are digital and can be read remotely by the utility company.
            </p>
            <h4>Main Service Panel</h4>
            <p>
                The main service panel, commonly known as the breaker box or circuit breaker panel, distributes power to all circuits throughout the building. Each circuit has a breaker that can shut itself off in the event of a short circuit or overload to cut power to the circuit. Old homes may have fuses instead of breakers. Fuses are just as effective as breakers, but most new panels today use breakers instead of fuses.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to note that power coming from the service lines to the electric meter, and then to the main service panel, is always live. Before working on these areas the power company must shut off the power. The power going out of the panel to the household circuits can be shut off by the main breaker in the service panel, but the power coming into the panel is not affected by the main breaker.
            </p>
            <h4>Electrical Boxes</h4>
            <p>
                An electrical box is a plastic or metal box used to connect wires and install devices such as switches, receptacles (outlets), and fixtures. An electrical box is almost always required for mounting devices and for housing wiring splices. Boxes come in many different sizes and several different shapes. A box must be sized appropriately for the number and size of wires entering the box. Metal electrical boxes must be grounded to the home's grounding system; plastic boxes do not need grounding because they are nonconductive.
            </p>
            <h4>Hot and Neutral Wires</h4>
            <p>
                Each electrical circuit contains at least one "hot" wire that carries the electrical current from the service panel to the circuit devices and a neutral wire that carries current back to the service panel. Hot wires typically are black or red but can be other colors. Neutral wires typically are white. In some circuits, the neutral wire is used as a hot wire and the circuit has no dedicated neutral.
            </p>
            <h4>Ground</h4>
            <p>
                An electrical ground is a safety system that provides a safe path for electricity to follow in the event of a short circuit, electrical surge, or other safety or fire hazard. In modern home wiring systems, each circuit has its own ground wire that leads back to the service panel. After the panel, the ground system terminates at a ground rod driven into soil or to another ground conductor where electricity is safely dissipated into the earth. Older homes may have ground systems that rely on metal electrical boxes, metal conduit (which houses wiring), and metal water pipes.
