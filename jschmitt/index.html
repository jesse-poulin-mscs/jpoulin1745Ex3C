                <p> It's a culinary miracle," is all I can think, as I reach deep into the 3-gallon fermenting crock and
                    pull out handfuls of the most beautiful, garnet-red sauerkraut I've ever seen. As I start packing
                    the kraut into jars, I'm taking little tastes and it's delicious, absolutely delicious. But I
                    already knew that because, in the six weeks since I'd packed the red cabbage, salt and caraway seeds
                    (just three ingredients!) into the crock, I'd been dipping in regularly to check the progress. It
                    had been improving continually, the saltiness receding and the flavors becoming more tangy and
                    complex.</p>

                <h1>Featured Recipe: Sauerkraut</h1>
                <p>Sauerkraut is probably the most well-known lacto-fermented vegetable. Old fashioned sauerkraut is
                    made with thinly sliced cabbage and salt. Like any traditionally homemade food, sauerkraut can be
                    made in a number of ways with a number of ingredients. Whether you add a secret ingredient to your
                    homemade sauerkraut or keep it basic, kraut has a slew of health benefits. It is rich in probiotics,
                    vitamins, fiber, and minerals, which can contribute to better digestion and a stronger immune
                    system. Sauerkraut can also help promote a healthy heart, stronger bones, and weight loss. Even if
                    each kraut-making method is different there are a few common basics to remember when making
                    fermented cabbage into sauerkraut at home.</p>

                <h3>EASY TIPS FOR MAKING GOOD SAUERKRAUT</h3>
                <p>Use fresh cabbage.
                    The better your ingredients, the better the finished product will be. Use at least some salt. Salt
                    is a traditional ingredient in sauerkraut because it increases shelf life, texture, and flavor. The
                    amount of salt used can vary according to personal taste preference. We recommend 1 to 3 Tbsp. per
                    quart of water. When making sauerkraut, its also important to choose the right salt, like celtic
                    sea salt. For those that don't want to use salt, check out our salt-free sauerkraut recipe. Create
                    an anaerobic environment. This is an absolute essential step in the sauerkraut-making process. The
                    cabbage must be completely submerged underneath a brine in order for the lactic acid bacteria to
                    proliferate. This is important for protecting your lactic acid fermentation from unwanted bacteria
                    (or mold). Fermentation weights can help keep your cabbage submerged. Give it time. You can ferment
                    sauerkraut for only a few days before moving to cold storage, but giving sauerkraut a lower
                    temperature and longer fermentation time can develop the flavor and texture a little better. We
                    suggest letting it ferment for 2 weeks, though experimenting with time and taste is the best way to
                    determine what time frame works best for you. Need more tips? Take a look at how to ferment
                    vegetables and when to place them in cold storage.</p>

                <h4>SUPPLIES FOR MAKING SAUERKRAUT</h4>

                <p>When it comes to
                    fermentation supplies, there are a lot of tools out there to choose from, each claiming to be the
                    best solution for perfectly fermented kraut. This can be a bit overwhelming you're new to making
                    fermented foods, and just trying to figure what you need to get started. Our tutorial Fermentation
                    Equipment: Choosing the Right Supplies goes into detail about different options, but the reality is
                    having the basics like a good knife, container for fermenting, a fermentation weight, and some sort
                    of lid with an airlock is all you need to get started.</p>

                        <li>
                            SLICING, POUNDING, AND KNEADING CABBAGE
                        </li>
                    </h4>
                    <p>Thinly slice cabbage, salt it, then pound it with a tool such as the
                        Cabbage Crusher or Pickle Packer for about 10 minutes, or until enough juice is released to form
                        a brine and completely cover the cabbage. Move the cabbage and juice to fermentation containers,
                        weight the cabbage down to keep it below the brine. Cover with tight-fitting lids, airlock lids,
                        or a tight-weave cloth, secured with a rubber band. </p>
                        <h4>

                                WEIGHTING AND PRESSING KRAUT IN A CROCK
                            </li>
                        </h4>
                        <p> Place shredded cabbage and salt in a large fermentation crock or bowl. Instead of pounding, weigh the
                            cabbage down with heavy bowls or pebbles. Press on the weights regularly to draw the natural juices
                            out of the cabbage and submerge the cabbage slowly in the brine. After a couple of days, with
                            continued pressing, the cabbage will have accumulated a fair amount of liquid at the top, enough to
                            cover the cabbage completely.</p>
                        <h4>
                            <li>
                                WHOLE CABBAGE HEADS WITH BRINE
                            </li>
                        </h4>
                        <p>In this method the cabbage is not shredded or sliced prior to fermenting. Since whole cabbage heads
                            cannot form their own brine fast
                            enough to protect them from mold and unwanted yeasts a brine is generally created then used for
                            fermenting. While this method is the least labor-intensive, it takes the longest. Four weeks or more
                            are necessary before moving to cold storage because of the size of the cabbage heads. Below you'll
                            find our basic sauerkraut recipe. This recipe utilizes the pounding and kneading method. It is a
                            great place to start for anyone just beginning to explore fermented vegetables. Once you've mastered
                            the basics, you can vary this recipe by adding other vegetables, herbs, and spices. Or use one of
