				What is a Subluxation?
		</h5>
            <p>
				A subluxation is a misaligned vertebra. The misaligned vertebra can result in pressure put on the nerves that exit the spinal cord. This pressure can result in pain, numbness, loss of sensation or other symptoms. These subluxations can be the result of many different events.

         <h5>What is an Adjustment?</h5>
            <p>
                An adjustment is what a chiropractor uses to treat a subluxation, or misaligned vertebra. Adjustments can vary from patient to patient depending on their body type and symptoms. Our chiropractors are specially trained to know what type of adjustment is necessary for each patient. Our chiropractors use a variety of different techniques including but not limited to: Diversified, Activator, Drop table, Gonstead adjustments, and many more different techniques.

          <h5>Are Chiropractic Adjustments Safe?</h5>
            <p>
				Yes, chiropractic care is safe and has an excellent safety record. A New Zealand government study found that adjustments are “remarkably safe.” Our well trained chiropractors use only the lightest force techniques that ensure the safety of our patients. It is the conservative and natural approach that makes chiropractic care so safe and helps millions of satisfied patients avoid harmful drugs or unnecessary surgery.
