            <p>Ever since I was little I have always enjoyed taking things apart to figure how they work.
               Sometimes, this led to some level of exasperation from my father when what I took apart didn't 
               work when I put it back together. I'm happy to say that things have changed for the better in
               that regard. Now my father calls me whenever he needs something fixed.</p>
            <p>I have developed quite a few skills over the years and honed them since buying my first home in 2010. 
               I know how frustrating it can be to have the desire but not the knowledge or skills to accomplish sometimes 
               even the smallest DIY projects and have met many people looking to learn more. The purpose of the Handyman's 
               Toolbox is to pass on some knowledge to those who have a desire to learn, and to offer up my services for 
               those that would rather hire out.</p>
