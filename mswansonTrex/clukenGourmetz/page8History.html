            <h3>History of Specialty Cheese:</h3>
            <p>History of Specialty Cheese: It is difficult to say when exactly cheese was first being produced. However, it is safe to say that the earliest cheeses were the hardest cheeses and were produced as a source of food to prevent spoilage. Cheeses were formed into wheels for ease of transportation so that cheese makers and customers could roll them on the ground.</p>
            <h3>History of Charcuterie</h3>
            <p>Similar to specialty cheese, Charcuterie did not start off being a luxury item. Charcuterie originated long before refrigeration technology was around. The method of curing meats was developed due to having a lack of access to something like refrigeration. When the meats were rubbed with salt, that salt would extract all of moisture contents which would in turn add a lot of flavor to the meat and it makes great snacks.
