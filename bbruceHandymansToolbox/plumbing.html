            <h3>How to sweat copper</h3>
            <img src="images/sweatingCopper.PNG" width="400"/>
            <p>Step 1: Assemble your tools and materials. For this job you're going to need a few things.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tube cutter</li>
                <li>Propane torch</li>
                <li>Emery cloth, 120 grit</li>
                <li>Flame protector cloth</li>
                <li>Fire extinguisher</li>
                <li>Fitting brush</li>
                <li>Striker (if your torch doesn't have one built in)</li>
                <li>Gloves</li>
                <li>Lead-free solder</li>
                <li>Paste flux</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Step 2: Cut your copper to length using the tube cutter. Go slow and avoid applying to much pressure as this can cause the pipe to dent.</p>
            <p>Step 3: Remove burrs inside the copper using the reaming attachment on your tube cutter.</p>
            <p>Step 4: Using the emery cloth, clean the outside of the pipe end until it shines.</p>
            <p>Step 5: Using the fitting brush, clean the inside of the pipe fitting.</p>
            <p>Step 6: Brush the outside of your tubing and the inside of the fitting with an even layer of flux. Then seat the tube into the fitting to full depth. Then wipe off any excess flux.</p>
            <p>Step 7: Apply heat. Heat the joint evenly holding the solder against the seam of the joint on the opposite side of the torch. The solder will melt and appear to suck into the joint. Make sure that that the joint appears full on all sides.</p>
            <p>Step 8: Allow the joint to cool and then test for leaks. Slowly turn the water on and watch for pinhole jets of water.</p>
            <p>Step 9: Put your tools and materials away! You'll thank yourself later!</p>

            <h3>6 Ways You Can Unclog a Toilet Bowl Without a Plunger</h3>
            <h4>Start With Dish Soap</h4>
            <p>As soon as the toilet clogs, learn how to unclog a toilet without a plunger and head to the kitchen and fetch some dish soap; the slippery soap should help lubricate the clogged pipe and allow the lodged debris slide down more easily. Pour about a half-cup into the toilet. If you haven’t got any dish soap on hand, chop a bar of soap into small chunks and drop the pieces into the toilet. And if none of these unconventional methods work to unclog your toilet, here’s our fool-proof guide for how to unclog a toilet. A $4.95 plunger and a handy toilet snake will make you the family hero!</p>
            <h4>Add Hot Water</h4>
            <p>If dish soap alone doesn’t do the trick for how to unclog a toilet without a plunger, adding water might move things along. Fill a bucket with hot bath water (boiling water could cause a porcelain toilet to crack), and pour the water into  the toilet from waist level. The force of the water could dislodge whatever is causing the clog.</p>
            <h4>DIY a Drain Snake Using a Wire Hanger</h4>
            <p>A more severe blockage could require manually moving the item. To do this without a plunger, unravel a wire coat hanger until it’s straight. Push one end of the wire into the clogged area. Prod the debris until it becomes free and flows down the drain. Voila! Another way to unclog a toilet without a plunger.</p>
            <h4>Try This Mixture</h4>
            <p>As an alternative to using dish soap and no plunger, try this all-natural solution: Pour 1 cup baking soda and 2 cups vinegar into the toilet. Allow it fizz for a half hour. If clog doesn’t dissipate, try the hot water trick. And try not to be too grossed out—here are 16 genius cleaning hacks you’ll want to steal from professional house cleaners. </p>
            <h4>Use a Plastic Bottle to Create Water Pressure</h4>
            <p>Warning: This how to unclog a toilet without a plunger trick could get messy. Start by removing as much water from the toilet bowl as possible (you can do this by repeatedly filling a small container with toilet water and pouring the water into a bucket). Next, fill a large plastic bottle with warm water. Place your thumb over the top of the bottle, and fit the top end of the bottle into the outlet at the bottom of the toilet (you’ll want to wear rubber gloves for this step). Remove your thumb and squeeze the bottle so the water inside shoots down the pipe. The added pressure could dislodge whatever was causing the clog.</p>
            <h4>Squirt Gun Toilet Drainer</h4>
            <p>When you’re repairing or replacing a toilet, you need to remove all the water. Simply shutting off the water supply and flushing won’t do it. A sponge works, but it’s kind of slow. So I use an old squirt gun to suck the water out and squirt it into a bucket, leaving just the last few drops to sponge out. </p>
